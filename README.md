# Phishing_websites_detection
As part of group project for MS in Georgia Tech, my team built an application "SureFire" to detect if a website is a phishing site using machine learning techniques, crowdsourcing and virusTotal statistics. 

To run server:
>python3 mainServer.py

To access UI:
http://localhost:9000

To run phishing scrapping:
>python3 phishing.py

To save to CSV from DB
>python save_csv.py
